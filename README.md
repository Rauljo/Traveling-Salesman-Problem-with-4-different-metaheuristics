# Traveling-Salesman-Problem-with-4-different-metaheuristics
In this repository 4 different metaheuristics (Simulated Temple, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms and Ant Colonies) will be implemented to solve the travelling salesman problem, which refers to the combinatorial minimization problem of finding the shortest route to visit a number of cities exactly once.
